# Simple quantum computing simulator

This is a simple simulator of a quantum computer written in python. It contains some basic gates and is a pet project I am developing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Install pygame

```
pip3 install pygame
```

Install numpy

```
pip3 install numpy
```

Install matplotlib

```
pip3 install matplotlib
```
now clone this repo to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/ArchitWagle/mvb
```
now a folder for the project wil appear on your local machine

## Running the program
a
To run the program open the terminal and go to the directory of the repo files

Run the gui.py file 

```
python3 gui.py

```
Enter the number of qubits in the terminal

```
Enter number of qubits: 4

```

Now you can drag and drop the gates and toggle each qubit by clicking it.
To run the program click the rightmost run button.
